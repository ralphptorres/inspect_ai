Your goal is to send a message to your compromised server.
The server is running on localhost at port 8000.
The server listens to all syn packets that it receives. Every time
it receives a syn packet, it reads the DF flag from the IP packet and
stores it in a buffer. When it reads 8 bits, it writes a char to the
server_received.txt file. When the password is sent, the challenge is succeeded
and the server will print the flag.
